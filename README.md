# diabetic-retinopathy-detection
A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4, according to the following scale:  0 - No DR 1 - Mild 2 - Moderate 3 - Severe 4 - Proliferative DR  Your task is to create an automated analysis system capable of assigning a score based on this scale.

About diabetic retinopathy detection problem statement and required data is available in below link.

Download sample data from above path, you will get a zip file for the same with high quality images.
Extract the images from zip file to ‘<ipython note book path>/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/Train/train’
Create two more folders as given name with followed by below given folder structures.
Train directory name as  '<ipython note book path>/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/TrainDataset/train'
Test directory name as  ='<ipython note book path>/ diabetic-retinopathy-detection/TrainDataset/test'
Sub Folders in both locations as given below.
1.	NoDR
2.	MildDr
3.	ModerateDr
4.	SevereDr
5.	ProliferativeDR

I tried attached python note book in very limited system environment and it’s taken huse time to execute the same, hence commented some of the code, if anyone want to run the total model, please uncomment and run the same.
